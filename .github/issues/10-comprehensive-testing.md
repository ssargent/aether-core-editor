## Description

Add comprehensive unit and integration tests for all services in the game engine backend to ensure reliability and maintainability.

## Requirements

### Test Types

- **Unit Tests** - Test individual service methods in isolation
- **Integration Tests** - Test service interactions with database
- **API Tests** - Test HTTP/gRPC endpoints end-to-end

### Coverage Areas

#### Service Testing
- [ ] WorldService comprehensive tests
- [ ] AttributeService tests
- [ ] CapabilityService tests
- [ ] CharacterClassService tests
- [ ] CurrencyService tests
- [ ] EnemyService tests
- [ ] ItemService tests
- [ ] NPCService tests
- [ ] RaceService tests
- [ ] WorldNodeService tests

#### Database Testing
- [ ] Database connection and migration tests
- [ ] Transaction handling tests
- [ ] Constraint validation tests
- [ ] Performance tests for complex queries

#### API Testing
- [ ] HTTP/Connect endpoint tests
- [ ] gRPC reflection tests
- [ ] Error response format tests
- [ ] Authentication/authorization tests (when implemented)

```

#### Test Requirements
- Use `testing` package and `testify` for assertions
- Mock database connections for unit tests
- Use test database for integration tests
- Achieve minimum 80% code coverage
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Include edge cases and boundary conditions

### Features

- [ ] Mock database layer for unit tests
- [ ] Test database setup and teardown
- [ ] Test data fixtures and factories
- [ ] Parallel test execution support
- [ ] Coverage reporting and metrics
- [ ] CI/CD integration for automated testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for critical paths

### Testing Tools

- `go test` - Built-in testing framework
- `testify` - Enhanced assertions and mocking
- `dockertest` - Docker containers for integration tests
- `go-sqlmock` - SQL driver mocking
- Coverage tools (`go test -cover`)

### Acceptance Criteria

- All services have comprehensive unit tests
- Integration tests cover database interactions
- API tests validate HTTP/gRPC endpoints
- Tests run in CI/CD pipeline
- Coverage reports show >80% coverage
- Tests run reliably and quickly
- Clear documentation for running tests

## Dependencies

- All service implementations must be complete
- Test database setup with Docker
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
