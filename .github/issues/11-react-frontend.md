## Description

Create a modern React TypeScript frontend application that provides a web-based editor interface for managing game world data using the connect-web library to communicate with the backend gRPC services.

## Requirements

### Technology Stack

- **React 18+** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **connect-web** for gRPC-Web communication
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Material-UI** or **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **React Query/TanStack Query** for data fetching and caching

### Core Features

#### World Management
- [ ] World list view with search and filtering
- [ ] World creation and editing forms
- [ ] World deletion with confirmation
- [ ] World node visualization and editing

#### Entity Management
- [ ] Item management interface
- [ ] NPC management with inventory
- [ ] Enemy configuration
- [ ] Character class and race editors
- [ ] Attribute and capability management
- [ ] Currency system interface

#### User Interface
- [ ] Responsive design for desktop and tablet
- [ ] Dark/light theme support
- [ ] Loading states and error handling
- [ ] Form validation with helpful error messages
- [ ] Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- [ ] Breadcrumb navigation
- [ ] Search and filtering capabilities

### Implementation Details

#### Setup and Configuration
- [ ] Initialize Vite + React + TypeScript project
- [ ] Configure connect-web for gRPC communication
- [ ] Set up routing with React Router
- [ ] Configure UI framework (Material-UI or Tailwind)
- [ ] Set up development environment with hot reload

#### API Integration
- [ ] Generate TypeScript types from protobuf definitions
- [ ] Create service clients for all backend services
- [ ] Implement error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Add request/response interceptors
- [ ] Handle authentication tokens (when implemented)

#### State Management
- [ ] Use React Query for server state management
- [ ] Implement optimistic updates for better UX
- [ ] Add offline support with query caching
- [ ] Handle real-time updates (future enhancement)

### Key Components

#### Navigation and Layout
- [ ] Main navigation sidebar
- [ ] Header with breadcrumbs and actions
- [ ] Footer with status information
- [ ] Modal management system

#### Data Tables and Lists
- [ ] Sortable, filterable data tables
- [ ] Pagination controls
- [ ] Bulk action support
- [ ] Export functionality

#### Forms and Editors
- [ ] Dynamic form generation
- [ ] Rich text editor for descriptions
- [ ] File upload components
- [ ] Validation and error display

### Development Features

- [ ] Storybook for component documentation
- [ ] Unit and integration tests with Jest/Vitest
- [ ] End-to-end tests with Playwright
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier configuration
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode
- [ ] Accessibility (a11y) compliance

### Build and Deployment

- [ ] Production build optimization
- [ ] Environment configuration
- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] Static asset optimization
- [ ] Bundle analysis and optimization

### Acceptance Criteria

- Modern, intuitive user interface
- Full CRUD operations for all entities
- Responsive design works on all screen sizes
- Fast loading times and smooth interactions
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Accessible interface following WCAG guidelines
- Well-documented components and API usage
- High test coverage for critical functionality

## Dependencies

- Backend API services must be implemented and running
- protobuf definitions for TypeScript code generation
- Development environment with Node.js and npm/yarn
